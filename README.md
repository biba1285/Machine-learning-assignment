# ML Classification on MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset

## 📝 Description
A complete end-to-end classification project applying multiple machine learning algorithms to distinguish gamma ray particles from hadrons using the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using advanced visualization and metrics.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 📊 Models Applied
- ✅ **Decision Tree**: Visualization up to level 3, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- ✅ **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classification with ROC curve  
- ✅ **Random Forest**: Tuned using GridSearchCV, with feature importance analysis  
- ✅ **AdaBoost**: Boosting model with tuned estimators and full evaluation

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- ROC Curve & AUC Score  
- Feature Importance (for Random Forest)
